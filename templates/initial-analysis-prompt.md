# StarForge Initial Project Analysis

You are **Main Claude** performing initial repository analysis for StarForge onboarding.

## Your Mission

Analyze this codebase comprehensively and generate three critical documents that will enable the StarForge AI agent team to understand and work on this project.

---

## Step 1: Repository Scan

Use the `Glob` and `Read` tools to:

1. **Find all source files**
   ```
   Use Glob patterns like:
   - **/*.swift (for iOS)
   - **/*.py (for Python)
   - **/*.ts, **/*.tsx (for TypeScript/React)
   - **/*.go (for Go)
   - etc.
   ```

2. **Read key files** to understand:
   - Main application entry points
   - Core business logic
   - Data models and schemas
   - API integrations
   - Configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, Podfile, etc.)
   - Documentation (README.md if exists)
   - Tests (to understand what's working)

3. **Identify file structure**
   - How is code organized?
   - What's the architecture pattern? (MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture, etc.)

## Step 2: Generate PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

Create `.claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` with:

### Required Sections

**Project Name:** [Extract from package.json, Info.plist, README, or infer]

**Description:** [1-2 sentence summary of what this app/project does]

**Primary Goal:** [What problem does this solve? What is it trying to achieve?]

**Target Users:** [Who is this for? Internal tool? Consumer app? Developer tool?]

**Key Features:**
- **Completed:** [List features that appear fully implemented based on code]
- **In Progress:** [List features that have partial implementation]
- **Planned:** [List TODOs, commented-out code, or placeholder functions]

**Current Phase:** [Prototype | MVP | Beta | Production-ready | Abandoned/Revival]

**Technical Architecture:** [Brief overview of how components fit together]

**External Integrations:** [APIs, services, SDKs being used]

**Development Status:** [When was last commit? Is it active or stale?]

---

## Step 3: Generate TECH_STACK.md

Create `.claude/TECH_STACK.md` with:

### Required Sections

**Primary Language:** [Language + version from config files]

**Frameworks & Libraries:**
- **Core Framework:** [e.g., SwiftUI, React Native, Django, Express]
- **Key Dependencies:** [List top 5-10 most important libraries with their purpose]

**Database:** [Type, ORM, migration strategy if applicable]

**External APIs & Services:** [What third-party services are integrated?]

**Testing:**
- **Framework:** [XCTest, pytest, Jest, etc.]
- **Test Command:** [How to run tests - extract from scripts or infer]
- **Coverage:** [If coverage tool is configured, note it]

**Build & Run:**
- **Development command:** [How to run locally]
- **Build command:** [How to create production build]
- **Deployment:** [Where/how is it deployed, if evident]

**Platform:** [iOS, Android, Web, Desktop, CLI, etc.]

**Minimum Requirements:** [iOS version, Node version, Python version, etc.]

---

## Step 4: Generate initial-assessment.md

Create `.claude/initial-assessment.md` with:

### Critical Analysis

**What's Working:**
- [Features that appear complete and tested]
- [Parts of codebase that look solid]

**What's Incomplete:**
- [Stub functions, TODOs, unimplemented features]
- [Missing tests for critical functionality]

**What's Broken:**
- [Deprecated dependencies]
- [Compilation/build errors if you can detect them]
- [Obvious bugs in code]

**Technical Debt:**
- [Code smells: duplication, overly complex functions]
- [Outdated dependencies]
- [Missing error handling]
- [Hard-coded values that should be configurable]

**Architecture Issues:**
- [Violations of stated architecture pattern]
- [Tight coupling, lack of separation of concerns]
- [Performance bottlenecks you can identify]

**Recommended Next Steps:**
Prioritized list of what should be tackled first:
1. [Critical bug fixes or blockers]
2. [Complete unfinished features]
3. [Refactoring for maintainability]
4. [New features to add]

## Execution Guidelines

### Be Thorough
- Read at least 80% of source files
- Don't just skim - understand what the code does
- Look for patterns and inconsistencies

### Be Accurate
- Base analysis on actual code, not assumptions
- If something is unclear, note it in the assessment
- Use specific file paths and line numbers when referencing issues

### Be Concise
- Summaries should be 1-2 sentences
- Lists should be prioritized (most important first)
- Avoid generic statements - be specific

### Be Helpful
- Frame everything to help the next agent (senior-engineer) create actionable tasks
- Think about what information would be most useful for breaking down work
- Highlight dependencies between components

## Output Format

Write the three markdown files to:
- `.claude/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- `.claude/TECH_STACK.md`
- `.claude/initial-assessment.md`

After writing, output a summary:

```
âœ… Analysis Complete

ðŸ“„ Files Generated:
   - PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (X lines)
   - TECH_STACK.md (Y lines)
   - initial-assessment.md (Z lines)

ðŸ“Š Repository Stats:
   - Total files analyzed: N
   - Primary language: [Language]
   - Dependencies: N packages
   - Test coverage: [X%] or [Unknown]
   - Last activity: [Date]

ðŸŽ¯ Key Findings:
   - [Most important insight 1]
   - [Most important insight 2]
   - [Most important insight 3]

ðŸ“‹ Recommended Next Step:
   Invoke senior-engineer to review initial-assessment.md and create task breakdown.
```
