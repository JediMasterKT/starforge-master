# Contributing to StarForge

Thank you for your interest in contributing to StarForge! This document outlines the development workflow and guidelines.

## Development Workflow

StarForge uses a **feature branch + pull request** workflow to ensure code quality and facilitate collaboration.

### The Golden Rule

**NEVER commit directly to `main`.**

All changes must go through the pull request review process.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### 1. Fork and Clone (First Time Only)

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/starforge-master.git
cd starforge-master

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/JediMasterKT/starforge-master.git
```

#### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Make sure you're on main
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull upstream main

# Create a feature branch with descriptive name
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/marketplace-integration`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/shell-detection-bug`)
- `docs/` - Documentation only (e.g., `docs/api-reference`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/cli-structure`)
- `test/` - Test additions/fixes (e.g., `test/installer-validation`)
- `workflow/` - CI/CD and workflow changes (e.g., `workflow/branch-protection`)

#### 3. Make Your Changes

```bash
# Edit files
# Test your changes locally
# Add tests if applicable
```

**For installer scripts:**
```bash
# Test the installer
bash tests/test-installer.sh

# Test CLI installation
bash bin/verify-cli.sh
```

**For backend changes (if working on agent templates):**
```bash
# Test agent definitions work in a sample project
cd /path/to/test-project
starforge update
starforge use senior-engineer
```

#### 4. Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "feat: Add feature X

Detailed description of what changed and why.

Closes #123"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>: <subject>

<body (optional)>

<footer (optional)>
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `chore:` - Build process, dependency updates

#### 5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
# Push your feature branch to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### 6. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to https://github.com/JediMasterKT/starforge-master
2. Click "Pull requests" â†’ "New pull request"
3. Click "compare across forks"
4. Select your fork and branch
5. Fill out the PR template completely
6. Submit for review

#### 7. Address Review Feedback

```bash
# Make requested changes
# Commit them
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Address review feedback"

# Push to update the PR
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### 8. Merge (Maintainer Only)

Once approved, the maintainer will merge your PR. Do not merge your own PRs.

## Code Review Process

### What Reviewers Look For

1. **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
2. **Tests**: Are there tests? Do they pass?
3. **Documentation**: Is the code documented? Is the README updated?
4. **Style**: Does it follow existing code style?
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Will this break existing installations?
6. **Security**: Are there any security implications?

### Review Timeline

- **Initial review**: Within 48 hours
- **Follow-up reviews**: Within 24 hours

## Testing Guidelines

### Installer Scripts

All changes to installer scripts MUST be tested:

```bash
# Run installer tests
bash tests/test-installer.sh

# Manual verification
bash bin/verify-cli.sh
```

### Agent Definitions

Test agent changes in a real project:

```bash
cd /path/to/test-project
starforge update
starforge use <agent-name>
# Verify agent behaves as expected
```

### CLI Commands

Test new CLI commands thoroughly:

```bash
# Test help text
starforge help

# Test the new command
starforge <new-command>

# Test error cases
starforge <new-command> --invalid-flag
```

## Code Style

### Bash Scripts

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Quote all variables: `"$VAR"` not `$VAR`
- Use `set -e` for error handling
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing formatting (2-space indents)

### Markdown Files

- Use ATX-style headers (`#` not underlines)
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- Use code fences with language identifiers
- Include examples for complex concepts

## What to Contribute

### High-Priority Contributions

- **Bug fixes**: Found a bug? Fix it!
- **Documentation**: Improve existing docs, add examples
- **Test coverage**: Add tests for untested code
- **Performance**: Optimize slow operations
- **User experience**: Make StarForge easier to use

### Medium-Priority Contributions

- **New agents**: Add specialized agent definitions
- **CLI enhancements**: New commands, better output
- **Platform support**: Windows compatibility, Linux testing
- **Integration**: IDE plugins, editor extensions

### What NOT to Contribute (Yet)

- **Breaking changes**: Discuss first in an issue
- **Massive refactors**: Propose in an issue first
- **Experimental features**: Create a discussion thread first
- **Paid features**: Needs business strategy alignment

## Questions?

- **Bug reports**: Open an issue with reproduction steps
- **Feature requests**: Open an issue describing the use case
- **Questions**: Open a discussion on GitHub Discussions
- **Security issues**: Email directly to repository owner

## CODEOWNERS

All PRs require approval from `@JediMasterKT`. This ensures:
- Consistent quality standards
- Backward compatibility
- Security review
- User experience coherence

## License
