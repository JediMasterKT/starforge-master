## Issues Found & Fixed During Testing

### Issue 1: Bash Version Compatibility ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Script failed with bash 3.2.57 (macOS default)

**Error Message:**
```
❌ Bash version too old: 3.2.57
```

**Root Cause:**
- macOS ships with bash 3.2.57 at `/bin/bash`
- Script requires bash 4.0+ for associative arrays
- `bin/starforge` shebang was hardcoded to `/bin/bash`

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed shebang from `#!/bin/bash` to `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Added bash version check with clear error message
- Works on macOS, Linux, any Unix system

**Files Modified:**
- `bin/starforge` (line 1)
- `templates/scripts/discord-setup.sh` (lines 11-25)

---

### Issue 2: Bot Token Corruption (598 chars instead of 72) ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Token was correct initially but corrupted when passed between functions

**Debug Output:**
```
[DEBUG] Token length after cleanup: 72 characters  ✓
[DEBUG] Token length: 598 characters  ✗
[DEBUG] HTTP Code: 401 Unauthorized
```

**Root Cause:**
- Log utility functions (`log_info`, `log_success`, `log_warn`) echoed to stdout
- User-facing echo statements in `get_bot_token()` and `get_server_id()` went to stdout
- Command substitution `local bot_token=$(get_bot_token)` captured ALL stdout
- Result: Variable contained log messages + token = 598 characters

**Fix Applied:**
- Redirected all log functions to stderr (`>&2`)
- Redirected all user-facing echo statements in `get_bot_token()` to stderr
- Redirected all user-facing echo statements in `get_server_id()` to stderr
- Only actual return values (token, server ID) go to stdout

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/scripts/discord-setup.sh` (lines 62-76, 103-117, 173-240)

---

### Issue 3: BOT_INVITE_URL Placeholder ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Invite URL contained placeholder `YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID`

**Display:**
```
Click this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_BOT_CLIENT_ID&permissions=536870912&scope=bot
```

**Root Cause:** Global variable had hardcoded placeholder that would never work

**Fix Applied:**
- Dynamically extract bot client ID from Discord API (`GET /users/@me`)
- Generate invite URL with real client ID at runtime
- Removed unused global placeholder

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/scripts/discord-setup.sh` (lines 40, 173-177, 200)

---

### Issue 4: ANSI Escape Codes Not Rendered ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Color codes showed as raw escape sequences instead of colored text

**Display:**
```
\033[0;36mhttps://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?...\033[0m
\033[0;36mstarforge use senior-engineer\033[0m
```

**Root Cause:** Using plain `echo` instead of `echo -e` to display color variables

**Fix Applied:**
- Changed `echo` to `echo -e` for lines with color variables
- ANSI escape codes now properly interpreted

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/scripts/discord-setup.sh` (lines 200, 600)

---

### Issue 5: Debug Output in Production ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Debug statements showing in user-facing output

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed all `[DEBUG]` output statements
- Cleaned up for production release

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/scripts/discord-setup.sh` (removed debug lines)

---
