# StarForge Daemon End-to-End Test Plan

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Purpose:** Validate daemon viability for autonomous 24/7 agent execution
**Status:** READY FOR EXECUTION

---

## Executive Summary

### Critical Unknown

**THE QUESTION:** Does `claude --mcp stdio --permission-mode bypassPermissions` work without TTY for autonomous agent invocation?

**Why This Matters:**
- Daemon code exists: 1,147 lines across `daemon-runner.sh` + `daemon.sh`
- **Never been tested end-to-end**
- This test determines if autonomous execution is viable
- If it fails, we fall back to PRIMARY CLAUDE interactive mode (proven to work)

### Test Philosophy

**Incremental Validation:**
1. Test smallest components first
2. STOP immediately on critical failures
3. Build confidence progressively
4. Get clear GO/NO-GO answer

**Time Investment:**
- **Critical Path:** 2 hours (Tests 1.1-1.5, 2.1-2.2, 3.1)
- **Full Suite:** 5 hours (all tests including resilience)
- **Recommendation:** Start with critical path

---

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Fresh StarForge installation
- [ ] Daemon deployed to `.claude/bin/` (CONFIRMED: daemon-runner.sh, daemon.sh, mcp-server.sh present)
- [ ] Dependencies installed:
  - [ ] `fswatch` (install: `brew install fswatch`)
  - [ ] `jq` (install: `brew install jq`)
  - [ ] `claude` CLI (should be in PATH)
- [ ] Test worktree created (isolated from main project)
- [ ] Clean git state (no pending changes that could interfere)

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for daemon
export STARFORGE_MAIN_REPO="/path/to/starforge-master"
export STARFORGE_CLAUDE_DIR="$STARFORGE_MAIN_REPO/.claude"
export STARFORGE_PROJECT_NAME="starforge-master"

# Optional: Enable parallel mode
export PARALLEL_DAEMON=false  # Start with sequential for testing
export MAX_CONCURRENT_AGENTS=999
```

### Test Worktree Setup

**Option A: Use Main Repo (Faster)**
```bash
cd /Users/krunaaltavkar/starforge-master
# Test in place - suitable for component tests
```

**Option B: Create Isolated Test Environment (Safer)**
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/starforge-daemon-test
cd /tmp/starforge-daemon-test
git init
# Copy minimal StarForge installation
cp -r /Users/krunaaltavkar/starforge-master/.claude .
# Test here - prevents pollution of main project
```

**Recommendation:** Use Option A for Tests 1.1-1.5, Option B for Tests 2.1+ (agent invocation)

### Log Monitoring Setup

**Terminal 1: Run tests**
```bash
cd /Users/krunaaltavkar/starforge-master
# Execute tests here
```

**Terminal 2: Monitor logs**
```bash
tail -f /Users/krunaaltavkar/starforge-master/.claude/logs/daemon.log
```

**Terminal 3: Watch trigger directory**
```bash
watch -n 1 'ls -la /Users/krunaaltavkar/starforge-master/.claude/triggers/'
```

# Component Tests (Unit Level)

## Test 1.1: Daemon Lifecycle

### Objective
Validate daemon can start, run in background, report status, and stop cleanly.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Daemon files deployed to `.claude/bin/`
- [ ] No existing daemon running (`starforge daemon status` shows "not running")

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Start Daemon
```bash
cd /Users/krunaaltavkar/starforge-master
starforge daemon start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Starting StarForge daemon...
✓ Daemon started successfully (PID: XXXXX)
Logs: /Users/krunaaltavkar/starforge-master/.claude/logs/daemon.log
```

**Validation Checks:**
- [ ] Exit code: 0
- [ ] PID file created: `.claude/daemon.pid`
- [ ] PID file contains valid process ID
- [ ] Process exists: `ps -p $(cat .claude/daemon.pid)` shows process
- [ ] Log file created: `.claude/logs/daemon.log`
- [ ] Log contains: `[YYYY-MM-DD] START: Daemon started (PID: XXXXX)`

#### Step 2: Check Status
```bash
starforge daemon status
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Daemon is running
  PID: XXXXX
  Uptime: Xs (or Xm/Xh)
  Log: /Users/krunaaltavkar/starforge-master/.claude/logs/daemon.log

Recent activity:
  [timestamp] START: Daemon started (PID: XXXXX)
  [timestamp] MODE: Sequential execution
  [timestamp] ORCHESTRATOR: Starting orchestrator periodic check (60s interval)
  [timestamp] MONITOR: Watching .claude/triggers for new triggers
```

**Validation Checks:**
- [ ] Exit code: 0
- [ ] Shows correct PID (matches daemon.pid)
- [ ] Uptime is reasonable (>0 seconds)
- [ ] Log file path displayed
- [ ] Recent activity shown

#### Step 3: Stop Daemon
```bash
starforge daemon stop
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Stopping StarForge daemon...
Sending SIGTERM to PID XXXXX...
✓ Daemon stopped successfully
```

**Validation Checks:**
- [ ] Exit code: 0
- [ ] Process terminated: `ps -p XXXXX` returns error
- [ ] PID file removed: `.claude/daemon.pid` does not exist
- [ ] Lock removed: `.claude/daemon.lock` directory does not exist
- [ ] Log contains: `[timestamp] STOP: Daemon shutting down gracefully`

#### Step 4: Verify Cleanup
```bash
starforge daemon status
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Daemon is not running

Last activity:
  [timestamp] STOP: Daemon shutting down gracefully
```

**Validation Checks:**
- [ ] Exit code: 1 (not running)
- [ ] No stale PID file
- [ ] No stale lock directory

### Success Criteria

**PASS Conditions:**
- [x] Daemon starts successfully
- [x] PID file created and valid
- [x] Status command shows running daemon
- [x] Stop command terminates cleanly
- [x] No stale files after stop
- [x] Logs show complete lifecycle

**FAIL Conditions:**
- [ ] Start command fails
- [ ] PID file not created
- [ ] Process not found after start
- [ ] Stop command hangs or fails
- [ ] Stale PID/lock files remain

**BLOCKER Criteria:**
- **If start fails:** Daemon cannot run → investigate daemon.sh issues
- **If stop fails:** Cleanup broken → investigate signal handling
- **If status fails:** Monitoring broken → investigate PID management

**Workaround Potential:** LOW - Basic process management must work

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Test 1.1 passed
- [ ] Daemon is running
- [ ] Trigger directory exists: `.claude/triggers/`

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Start Daemon with Log Monitoring
```bash
# Terminal 1
starforge daemon start

# Terminal 2
tail -f .claude/logs/daemon.log
```

#### Step 2: Create Test Trigger File
```bash
# Terminal 3
touch .claude/triggers/test-trigger-$(date +%s).trigger
```

#### Step 3: Verify Detection
**Check Terminal 2 (log monitor) within 5 seconds:**

**Expected Log Entry:**
```
[YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ] TRIGGER: Detected: test-trigger-XXXXXXXXXX.trigger
```

#### Step 4: Create Multiple Triggers
```bash
for i in {1..3}; do
  touch .claude/triggers/test-multi-$i.trigger
  sleep 1
done
```

**Expected: 3 log entries, one for each file**

#### Step 5: Cleanup
```bash
rm .claude/triggers/test-*.trigger
starforge daemon stop
```

### Success Criteria

**PASS Conditions:**
- [x] `fswatch` process running (child of daemon)
- [x] Trigger creation detected within 2 seconds
- [x] Log entry appears: `TRIGGER: Detected: [filename]`
- [x] Multiple triggers detected in sequence
- [x] Only `.trigger` files trigger events (not `.txt`, etc.)

**FAIL Conditions:**
- [ ] `fswatch` not running
- [ ] No log entry after trigger creation
- [ ] Detection delay >5 seconds
- [ ] False positives (detects non-.trigger files)

**BLOCKER Criteria:**
- **If fswatch not installed:** Install required → `brew install fswatch`
- **If no detection:** File watching broken → cannot proceed
- **If detection delayed >10s:** Performance issue → investigate fswatch config

**Workaround Potential:** MEDIUM - Could use polling as fallback, but not ideal

## Test 1.5: Claude CLI Non-Interactive ⚠️ CRITICAL

### Objective
**THE CRITICAL TEST:** Validate `claude --mcp stdio --permission-mode bypassPermissions` works without TTY for autonomous agent invocation.

### Why This Is Critical
This is the **make-or-break test** for the daemon. If this fails, autonomous execution is not viable.

**From daemon-runner.sh line 248:**
```bash
if timeout "$AGENT_TIMEOUT" "$CLAUDE_DIR/bin/mcp-server.sh" | claude \
  --mcp stdio \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions \
  "Use the $to_agent agent. $prompt" >> "$LOG_FILE" 2>&1; then
```

**Question:** Can Claude CLI run piped commands without interactive terminal?

### Prerequisites
- [ ] `claude` CLI installed and in PATH
- [ ] Claude CLI authenticated (`claude auth status`)
- [ ] MCP server working (Test 1.4 passed)

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Verify Claude CLI Exists
```bash
which claude
claude --version
```

**Expected:**
```
/path/to/claude
Claude CLI version X.Y.Z
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] `claude` command found
- [ ] Version displayed

#### Step 2: Test Basic Non-Interactive Invocation
```bash
echo "Echo hello world" | timeout 10 claude --print
```

**Expected:**
```
hello world
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Command completes without hanging
- [ ] Output is produced
- [ ] Exit code: 0
- [ ] No TTY error messages

#### Step 3: Test MCP Mode with Pipe (Simple)
```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","id":1}' | timeout 10 claude --mcp stdio "Echo test"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Command completes (doesn't hang)
- Output produced
- Exit code: 0

**Potential Issues:**
- Command hangs waiting for input
- Error: "TTY required"
- Error: "stdin must be a terminal"
- Claude CLI opens GUI (blocks daemon)

#### Step 4: Test Full Daemon-Style Invocation
```bash
timeout 30 .claude/bin/mcp-server.sh | claude \
  --mcp stdio \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions \
  "List files in current directory using bash tool"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- [ ] Command completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] No GUI windows opened
- [ ] Output captured (files listed)
- [ ] Exit code: 0
- [ ] No permission prompts

**Critical Validation:**
```bash
echo $?  # Exit code must be 0
```

#### Step 5: Test with Longer Task (Agent-Like)
```bash
timeout 60 .claude/bin/mcp-server.sh | claude \
  --mcp stdio \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions \
  "Create a test file named test-daemon-output.txt with the content 'Hello from daemon' using bash tool"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- [ ] File created: `test-daemon-output.txt`
- [ ] File contains: "Hello from daemon"
- [ ] Command completes without hanging
- [ ] No GUI interaction required
- [ ] Exit code: 0

**Validation:**
```bash
cat test-daemon-output.txt
# Should output: Hello from daemon

rm test-daemon-output.txt  # Cleanup
```

#### Step 6: Test Background Process (True Daemon Simulation)
```bash
# Run in background like daemon would
nohup timeout 60 .claude/bin/mcp-server.sh | claude \
  --mcp stdio \
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions \
  "Create test-background.txt with content 'Background test'" \
  >> /tmp/claude-test.log 2>&1 &

BG_PID=$!

# Wait for completion
wait $BG_PID
echo "Exit code: $?"

# Check result
cat test-background.txt
cat /tmp/claude-test.log

# Cleanup
rm test-background.txt /tmp/claude-test.log
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Background process completes
- [ ] File created successfully
- [ ] Log captured
- [ ] Exit code: 0

### Success Criteria

**PASS Conditions:**
- [x] Claude CLI runs without TTY
- [x] `--mcp stdio` accepts piped input
- [x] `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` prevents prompts
- [x] Commands execute successfully
- [x] No GUI windows opened
- [x] Works in background (nohup)
- [x] Exit codes are accurate

**FAIL Conditions:**
- [ ] Command hangs indefinitely
- [ ] Requires TTY/interactive terminal
- [ ] Opens GUI windows
- [ ] Permission prompts appear despite bypass flag
- [ ] Doesn't work in background

**BLOCKER Criteria:**

**If FAIL → Daemon NOT VIABLE**

This is the critical test. If it fails:
- **Autonomous agent invocation is not possible**
- **Must fall back to PRIMARY CLAUDE interactive mode**
- **Daemon deferred to future version**
- **Document findings and recommend alternatives**

**Workaround Potential:** NONE - This is fundamental requirement

# Integration Tests (Component Pairs)

**CRITICAL: Only proceed to Integration Tests if Test 1.5 PASSED.**

**If Test 1.5 failed, STOP here and document findings.**

---

## Test 2.1: Trigger → Agent Invocation

### Objective
Validate daemon detects trigger file and attempts to invoke the specified agent.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] All component tests (1.1-1.5) passed
- [ ] Test 1.5 confirmed Claude CLI works non-interactively
- [ ] Daemon is stopped

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Prepare Test Environment
```bash
# Clean state
rm -rf .claude/triggers/*.trigger
rm -rf .claude/triggers/processed/

# Start daemon
starforge daemon start

# Monitor logs
tail -f .claude/logs/daemon.log &
TAIL_PID=$!
```

#### Step 2: Create Simple Test Trigger
```bash
cat > .claude/triggers/test-invocation.trigger << 'EOF'
{
  "to_agent": "junior-engineer",
  "from_agent": "test-harness",
  "action": "echo_test",
  "message": "Echo 'Test successful' to stdout",
  "ticket": "#TEST-001"
}
EOF
```

#### Step 3: Observe Daemon Logs
**Within 5 seconds, expect these log entries:**

```
[timestamp] TRIGGER: Detected: test-invocation.trigger
[timestamp] INVOKE: test-harness → junior-engineer (echo_test)
[timestamp] TASKTOOL: Invoking junior-engineer via Task tool
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Trigger detected
- [ ] JSON parsed correctly
- [ ] Agent invocation attempted
- [ ] MCP server process spawned

#### Step 4: Check Process Tree
```bash
ps aux | grep -E "mcp-server|claude"
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] `mcp-server.sh` process running
- [ ] `claude` process running with `--mcp stdio` argument

#### Step 5: Wait for Completion or Timeout
**Expected:**
- Daemon logs either:
  - `COMPLETE: junior-engineer completed in Xs` (success)
  - `ERROR: junior-engineer failed (exit: X)` (failure)
  - `ERROR: junior-engineer timed out after 1800s` (timeout)

**Check archived trigger:**
```bash
ls .claude/triggers/processed/
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Trigger moved to `processed/` directory
- [ ] Filename timestamped: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-test-invocation.trigger`

#### Step 6: Cleanup
```bash
kill $TAIL_PID
starforge daemon stop
```

### Success Criteria

**PASS Conditions:**
- [x] Daemon detects trigger within 2 seconds
- [x] Trigger JSON parsed correctly
- [x] Agent invocation attempted
- [x] MCP server process spawned
- [x] Claude CLI process spawned
- [x] Invocation logged with correct parameters
- [x] Trigger archived after processing

**FAIL Conditions:**
- [ ] Trigger not detected
- [ ] JSON parsing fails on valid trigger
- [ ] Agent invocation not attempted
- [ ] Processes not spawned
- [ ] Trigger not archived

**BLOCKER Criteria:**
- **If trigger not detected:** File watching broken (but Test 1.2 should have caught this)
- **If parsing fails:** JSON handling broken (but Test 1.3 should have caught this)
- **If invocation not attempted:** Integration broken → investigate daemon-runner.sh logic
- **If processes not spawned:** System call failure → investigate environment

**Workaround Potential:** MEDIUM - Could debug invocation logic

## Test 2.2: Agent Execution → Completion

### Objective
Validate agent actually executes the task and completes successfully, with output captured.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Test 2.1 passed
- [ ] Daemon can invoke agents

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Prepare Test Task
```bash
# Clean state
rm -f test-agent-output.txt
starforge daemon start
```

#### Step 2: Create Task Trigger (Simple File Creation)
```bash
cat > .claude/triggers/test-execution.trigger << 'EOF'
{
  "to_agent": "junior-engineer",
  "from_agent": "test-harness",
  "action": "create_file",
  "message": "Create a file named test-agent-output.txt with the content 'Agent execution successful' using the Write tool",
  "ticket": "#TEST-002"
}
EOF
```

#### Step 3: Monitor Execution
```bash
tail -f .claude/logs/daemon.log
```

**Expected Log Sequence:**
```
[timestamp] TRIGGER: Detected: test-execution.trigger
[timestamp] INVOKE: test-harness → junior-engineer (create_file)
[timestamp] TASKTOOL: Invoking junior-engineer via Task tool
... (agent working, may take 30-120 seconds)
[timestamp] COMPLETE: junior-engineer completed in Xs
```

#### Step 4: Verify Task Output
```bash
# Check if file was created
ls -la test-agent-output.txt

# Check file content
cat test-agent-output.txt
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] File exists: `test-agent-output.txt`
- [ ] File contains: "Agent execution successful"
- [ ] File ownership: current user
- [ ] File created timestamp: recent (within last 2 minutes)

#### Step 5: Check Trigger Archival
```bash
ls .claude/triggers/processed/ | grep test-execution
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Trigger archived to `processed/` (not `processed/failed/`)
- [ ] Archive indicates success

#### Step 6: Verify Daemon State
```bash
starforge daemon status
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Daemon still running (didn't crash)
- [ ] Processed count incremented
- [ ] No errors in recent activity

#### Step 7: Cleanup
```bash
rm test-agent-output.txt
starforge daemon stop
```

### Success Criteria

## Test 2.3: Agent Completion → New Trigger (Handoff Cycle)

### Objective
Validate stop hook creates new trigger when agent completes, enabling automatic handoff to next agent.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Test 2.2 passed
- [ ] Agents can execute tasks
- [ ] Stop hook configured: `.claude/hooks/stop.py`

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Verify Stop Hook Exists
```bash
ls -la .claude/hooks/stop.py
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] File exists
- [ ] File is executable
- [ ] File contains trigger creation logic

#### Step 2: Start Daemon
```bash
starforge daemon start
tail -f .claude/logs/daemon.log &
TAIL_PID=$!
```

#### Step 3: Create Initial Trigger (Junior-Engineer Task)
```bash
cat > .claude/triggers/test-handoff.trigger << 'EOF'
{
  "to_agent": "junior-engineer",
  "from_agent": "orchestrator",
  "action": "implement_feature",
  "message": "Create test-handoff.txt with content 'Feature implemented'",
  "ticket": "#TEST-003"
}
EOF
```

#### Step 4: Monitor for Handoff
**Expected Log Sequence:**

```
# First agent (junior-engineer) runs
[timestamp] TRIGGER: Detected: test-handoff.trigger
[timestamp] INVOKE: orchestrator → junior-engineer (implement_feature)
[timestamp] TASKTOOL: Invoking junior-engineer via Task tool
... (agent working)
[timestamp] COMPLETE: junior-engineer completed in Xs

# Stop hook creates new trigger
[timestamp] TRIGGER: Detected: junior-engineer-qa_engineer-XXXXXXXXXX.trigger

# Second agent (qa-engineer) runs automatically
[timestamp] INVOKE: junior-engineer → qa-engineer (review_pr)
[timestamp] TASKTOOL: Invoking qa-engineer via Task tool
... (QA agent working)
[timestamp] COMPLETE: qa-engineer completed in Xs
```

#### Step 5: Verify Trigger Files
```bash
# Check triggers directory
ls .claude/triggers/*.trigger

# Check processed directory
ls .claude/triggers/processed/
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Original trigger archived: `test-handoff.trigger`
- [ ] Handoff trigger created (then archived): `junior-engineer-qa_engineer-*.trigger`
- [ ] Both triggers archived to `processed/`

#### Step 6: Verify Task Outputs
```bash
# Junior-engineer output
cat test-handoff.txt

# QA-engineer may have created review output
ls test-handoff.txt
# Should still exist (QA approved it)
```

#### Step 7: Check Daemon State
```bash
starforge daemon status
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Processed count: 2 (both triggers processed)
- [ ] Daemon still running
- [ ] No errors

#### Step 8: Cleanup
```bash
kill $TAIL_PID
rm test-handoff.txt
starforge daemon stop
```

### Success Criteria

**PASS Conditions:**
- [x] First agent (junior-engineer) completes successfully
- [x] Stop hook creates new trigger file
- [x] New trigger has correct format (to_agent, from_agent, action)
- [x] Second agent (qa-engineer) invoked automatically
- [x] Handoff latency <10 seconds
- [x] Both agents complete successfully
- [x] Both triggers archived properly
- [x] Daemon processes both without manual intervention

**FAIL Conditions:**
- [ ] First agent fails
- [ ] Stop hook doesn't create trigger
- [ ] New trigger has invalid format
- [ ] Second agent not invoked
- [ ] Handoff latency >30 seconds
- [ ] Either agent fails
- [ ] Daemon requires manual intervention

**BLOCKER Criteria:**
- **If stop hook doesn't create trigger:** Handoff broken → must fix hook
- **If second agent not invoked:** Continuous execution broken → investigate daemon loop
- **If handoff latency >30s:** Performance issue → investigate file watching delay

**Workaround Potential:** MEDIUM - Could manually trigger agents, but defeats autonomous purpose

# End-to-End Tests (Full Workflow)

**CRITICAL: Only proceed to E2E tests if all Integration Tests (2.1-2.3) passed.**

---

## Test 3.1: Single Agent Task (End-to-End)

### Objective
Full end-to-end test of daemon autonomously executing a complete agent task from trigger creation to verified output.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] All integration tests (2.1-2.3) passed
- [ ] Clean environment (no pending triggers)

### Test Scenario

**User Story:** "I want the daemon to automatically have junior-engineer create a hello world Python script."

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Prepare Environment
```bash
# Clean state
rm -f hello.py
rm -rf .claude/triggers/*.trigger
rm -rf .claude/triggers/processed/

# Verify daemon not running
starforge daemon status
```

#### Step 2: Start Daemon with Monitoring
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start daemon
starforge daemon start

# Terminal 2: Monitor logs
tail -f .claude/logs/daemon.log

# Terminal 3: Watch trigger directory
watch -n 1 'ls -la .claude/triggers/'
```

#### Step 3: Create Realistic Task Trigger
```bash
cat > .claude/triggers/create-hello-world.trigger << 'EOF'
{
  "to_agent": "junior-engineer",
  "from_agent": "orchestrator",
  "action": "implement_feature",
  "message": "Create a Python script named hello.py that prints 'Hello, StarForge!' when executed. Include a proper shebang and make it executable.",
  "ticket": "#E2E-001",
  "context": {
    "file_path": "hello.py",
    "requirements": [
      "Python 3.x compatible",
      "Executable permissions",
      "Proper shebang line"
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

#### Step 4: Observe Full Lifecycle (No Human Intervention)

**Expected Timeline:**

| Time | Event | Log Entry |
|------|-------|-----------|
| T+0s | Trigger created | Manual step |
| T+1s | Trigger detected | `TRIGGER: Detected: create-hello-world.trigger` |
| T+2s | Agent invoked | `INVOKE: orchestrator → junior-engineer (implement_feature)` |
| T+3s | Agent starts | `TASKTOOL: Invoking junior-engineer via Task tool` |
| T+60s | Agent working | (no log, agent executing) |
| T+90s | Agent completes | `COMPLETE: junior-engineer completed in 88s` |
| T+91s | Trigger archived | `ARCHIVE: Trigger create-hello-world.trigger → success` |

**Watch for:**
- [ ] Trigger file disappears from `.claude/triggers/`
- [ ] Trigger appears in `.claude/triggers/processed/`
- [ ] `hello.py` file created in current directory

#### Step 5: Verify Output Quality

```bash
# Check file exists
ls -la hello.py

# Check shebang
head -1 hello.py

# Check content
cat hello.py

# Check executable
test -x hello.py && echo "Executable" || echo "Not executable"

# Test execution
python3 hello.py
```

**Expected hello.py:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Hello, StarForge!")
```

**Expected execution output:**
```
Hello, StarForge!
```

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] File exists: `hello.py`
- [ ] Has shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- [ ] Contains print statement
- [ ] Is executable (`chmod +x`)
- [ ] Runs successfully
- [ ] Outputs correct message

#### Step 6: Verify Daemon State
```bash
starforge daemon status
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Daemon still running
- [ ] Processed count: 1
- [ ] No errors
- [ ] Recent activity shows completion

#### Step 7: Check Logs for Errors
```bash
grep -i error .claude/logs/daemon.log
grep -i fail .claude/logs/daemon.log
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] No ERROR entries (except expected ones from testing)
- [ ] No FAIL entries
- [ ] Clean execution

#### Step 8: Cleanup
```bash
rm hello.py
starforge daemon stop
```

### Success Criteria

**PASS Conditions:**
- [x] Daemon detects trigger automatically
- [x] Agent invoked without manual intervention
- [x] Agent executes task correctly
- [x] Output file created with correct content
- [x] File has correct permissions (executable)
- [x] File executes successfully
- [x] Completion logged accurately
- [x] Trigger archived properly
- [x] Daemon remains stable
- [x] Total time <5 minutes
- [x] Zero human intervention after trigger creation

**FAIL Conditions:**
- [ ] Trigger not detected

- [ ] Task execution fails
- [ ] Output file incorrect or missing
- [ ] File not executable
- [ ] Execution produces errors
- [ ] No completion logged
- [ ] Trigger not archived
- [ ] Daemon crashes
- [ ] Requires human intervention

**BLOCKER Criteria:**
- **If daemon doesn't detect trigger:** File watching broken → catastrophic
- **If agent fails to execute task:** Agent integration broken → cannot proceed
- **If output is incorrect:** Agent capability issue → may need prompt tuning
- **If daemon crashes:** Stability issue → must fix before production

**Workaround Potential:** LOW - This is core end-to-end functionality

## Test 3.2: Multi-Agent Handoff (Full Autonomous Chain)

### Objective
Validate daemon can orchestrate a complete multi-agent workflow: orchestrator → junior-engineer → qa-engineer, with zero human intervention.

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Test 3.1 passed
- [ ] Stop hooks working (Test 2.3 passed)
- [ ] Clean environment

### Test Scenario

**User Story:** "I create a simple feature request. The daemon autonomously coordinates: junior-engineer implements it, then qa-engineer reviews it, without any manual steps."

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Prepare Clean Environment
```bash
rm -f feature.py test_feature.py
rm -rf .claude/triggers/*.trigger
rm -rf .claude/triggers/processed/
```

#### Step 2: Start Daemon with Full Monitoring
```bash
# Terminal 1: Daemon
starforge daemon start

# Terminal 2: Logs
tail -f .claude/logs/daemon.log

# Terminal 3: Trigger directory
watch -n 1 'ls .claude/triggers/*.trigger 2>/dev/null | wc -l'
```

#### Step 3: Create Initial Feature Request Trigger
```bash
cat > .claude/triggers/feature-request.trigger << 'EOF'
{
  "to_agent": "junior-engineer",
  "from_agent": "orchestrator",
  "action": "implement_feature",
  "message": "Create a Python function file named feature.py with a function add(a, b) that returns a + b. Include docstring and a simple test.",
  "ticket": "#E2E-002",
  "context": {
    "file_path": "feature.py",
    "requirements": [
      "Function: add(a, b) returns sum",
      "Include docstring",
      "Include simple test at bottom"
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

#### Step 4: Observe Autonomous Multi-Agent Chain

T+151s [DAEMON] ARCHIVE: Trigger junior-engineer-qa_engineer-*.trigger → success
```

**Key Validation Points:**
- [ ] Only 1 manual step (creating initial trigger)
- [ ] 2 agents run sequentially
- [ ] Stop hook creates handoff trigger automatically
- [ ] No daemon restarts needed
- [ ] No human intervention after initial trigger

#### Step 5: Verify Intermediate Outputs

**After Junior-Engineer (Phase 1):**
```bash
# Wait for first completion log entry
grep "COMPLETE: junior-engineer" .claude/logs/daemon.log

# Verify implementation file created
ls -la feature.py
cat feature.py
```

**Expected feature.py:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Feature module with basic arithmetic.
"""

def add(a, b):
    """
    Add two numbers.

    Args:
        a: First number
        b: Second number

    Returns:
        Sum of a and b
    """
    return a + b


# Simple test
if __name__ == "__main__":
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    print("All tests passed!")
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] File exists
- [ ] Has docstring
- [ ] Function defined correctly
- [ ] Test included

#### Step 6: Verify Handoff Trigger Created

```bash
# Check for handoff trigger (may be brief, gets processed quickly)
ls .claude/triggers/junior-engineer-qa_engineer-*.trigger 2>/dev/null || echo "Already processed"

# Check processed directory
ls .claude/triggers/processed/ | grep junior-engineer-qa_engineer
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Handoff trigger created by stop hook
- [ ] Handoff trigger processed (archived)

#### Step 7: Verify QA Review Outputs

**After QA-Engineer (Phase 3):**
```bash
# Wait for second completion log entry
grep "COMPLETE: qa-engineer" .claude/logs/daemon.log

# Check if QA created any review artifacts
ls -la test_feature.py 2>/dev/null || echo "QA may not create separate test file"

# Check if feature.py was modified by QA
cat feature.py
```

**QA Validation:**
- [ ] QA reviewed the code
- [ ] QA tested the function
- [ ] QA may have added comments or improved tests
- [ ] No errors reported by QA

#### Step 8: Execute Final Output
```bash
python3 feature.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
All tests passed!
```

**Final Validation:**
- [ ] Code runs successfully
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] No errors

#### Step 9: Verify Complete Autonomous Chain
```bash
# Check daemon state
starforge daemon status

# Count processed triggers
ls .claude/triggers/processed/*.trigger | wc -l
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] 2 triggers processed (original + handoff)
- [ ] Daemon still running
- [ ] No errors
- [ ] Total time <5 minutes

#### Step 10: Review Complete Log
```bash
grep -E "TRIGGER|INVOKE|COMPLETE" .claude/logs/daemon.log
```

**Expected log sequence:**
```
TRIGGER: Detected: feature-request.trigger
INVOKE: orchestrator → junior-engineer (implement_feature)
COMPLETE: junior-engineer completed in 87s
TRIGGER: Detected: junior-engineer-qa_engineer-XXXXX.trigger
INVOKE: junior-engineer → qa-engineer (review_implementation)
COMPLETE: qa-engineer completed in 55s
```

#### Step 11: Cleanup
```bash
rm feature.py test_feature.py 2>/dev/null
starforge daemon stop
```

### Success Criteria

**PASS Conditions:**
- [x] Initial trigger processed successfully
- [x] Junior-engineer completes implementation
- [x] Feature file created with correct content
- [x] Stop hook creates handoff trigger automatically

- [ ] Stop hook doesn't create handoff trigger
- [ ] Handoff trigger not detected
- [ ] QA-engineer not invoked
- [ ] Manual intervention required
- [ ] Final output is incorrect or broken
- [ ] Daemon crashes or hangs

**BLOCKER Criteria:**
- **If handoff doesn't work:** Autonomous chain broken → core functionality failure
- **If either agent fails:** Integration issue → must fix
- **If total time >10 minutes:** Performance issue → investigate bottlenecks
- **If daemon crashes:** Stability issue → critical bug

**Workaround Potential:** NONE - This is the core value proposition of the daemon

## Additional Tests (3.3-3.5)

Due to length constraints, I'll provide abbreviated templates for the remaining tests. These can be executed if time permits and Tests 3.1-3.2 pass.

### Test 3.3: Error Handling

**Quick Reference:**
- **Objective:** Validate daemon handles errors gracefully
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Invalid agent name in trigger → Daemon logs error, archives to `failed/`
  2. Agent command fails → Retry logic kicks in (3 attempts)
  3. Agent times out → Daemon logs timeout, terminates agent
  4. Malformed trigger → Archived to `invalid/`, daemon continues
- **Success:** Daemon never crashes, all errors logged, appropriate archival
- **Time:** 20 minutes

### Test 3.4: Parallel Execution

**Quick Reference:**
- **Objective:** Validate parallel mode works (multiple agents running simultaneously)
- **Setup:** `export PARALLEL_DAEMON=true && export MAX_CONCURRENT_AGENTS=3`
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Create 3 triggers for different agents
  2. All 3 should run concurrently
  3. Verify slot management (no conflicts)
  4. Check agent-slots.json for state tracking
- **Success:** 3 agents run in parallel, complete successfully, no race conditions
- **Time:** 20 minutes

### Test 3.5: 24/7 Resilience

**Quick Reference:**
- **Objective:** Validate daemon stability over extended run
- **Setup:** Let daemon run for 1 hour, create triggers every 10 minutes
- **Test Cases:**
  1. Start daemon, monitor for 1 hour
  2. Create 6 triggers (1 every 10 minutes)
  3. Check for memory leaks (`ps aux | grep daemon-runner`)
  4. Check for hung processes
  5. Verify all triggers processed
- **Success:** Daemon runs continuously, no crashes, no memory leaks, all triggers processed
- **Time:** 60 minutes (can run in background)

# Go/No-Go Decision Framework

## Decision Matrix

After executing tests, use this matrix to determine daemon viability:

| Test Result | Decision | Action |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Tests 1.1-1.5 ALL PASS** | ✅ GO (Proceed to Integration) | Continue to Tests 2.1-2.3 |
| **Test 1.5 FAILS** | ❌ NO-GO | STOP testing, document blocker, use PRIMARY CLAUDE mode |
| **Tests 2.1-2.2 PASS** | ✅ GO (Proceed to E2E) | Continue to Tests 3.1-3.2 |
| **Tests 2.1-2.2 FAIL** | ⚠️ NEEDS WORK | Fix agent invocation logic, re-test |
| **Tests 3.1-3.2 PASS** | ✅✅ GO (Ship Daemon) | Daemon viable for v1.1, integrate into MVP |
| **Test 3.1 or 3.2 FAILS** | ⚠️ NEEDS WORK | Fix integration issues, re-test |
| **Tests 3.3-3.5 FAIL** | ⚠️ ACCEPTABLE | Ship with known limitations, document in release notes |

## GO Decision: Ship Daemon for v1.1

**Conditions:**
- [x] Tests 1.1-1.5 pass (all component tests)
- [x] Tests 2.1-2.2 pass (agent invocation works)
- [x] Test 3.1 passes (single agent E2E works)

**Recommendation:**
```
✅ SHIP DAEMON

Autonomous 24/7 agent execution is VIABLE.

Evidence:
- Claude CLI works non-interactively (Test 1.5 passed)
- Daemon can invoke agents (Test 2.1 passed)
- Agents execute tasks successfully (Test 2.2 passed)
- End-to-end workflow complete (Test 3.1 passed)

Next Steps:
1. Integrate daemon into MVP (docs/MVP-PLAN.md)
2. Update install.sh to deploy daemon by default
3. Update documentation with daemon usage
4. Create user guide: "Using Daemon Mode"
5. Test on 3 different environments (Mac, Linux, different projects)
6. Ship v1.1 with daemon as PRIMARY mode (PRIMARY CLAUDE as fallback)
```

## NO-GO Decision: Defer Daemon, Use PRIMARY CLAUDE

**Conditions:**
- [ ] Test 1.5 fails (Claude CLI doesn't work non-interactively)
- [ ] Tests 2.1-2.2 fail (agent invocation broken)

**Recommendation:**
```
❌ DEFER DAEMON

Autonomous execution NOT viable due to [specific blocker].

Blocker Identified:
[Describe the specific failure - e.g., "Claude CLI requires TTY, cannot run piped commands"]

Evidence:
- Test 1.5 failed: [paste failure details]
- Claude CLI error: [paste error message]

Decision:
- Daemon deferred to v1.3+ (post-MVP)
- Use PRIMARY CLAUDE interactive mode for v1.1 (proven to work)
- Document blocker in: docs/blockers/daemon-cli-limitation.md

Next Steps:
1. Document blocker with full test results
2. Create GitHub issue: "Daemon Blocked: Claude CLI Limitation"
3. Research alternatives:
   - Contact Anthropic about non-interactive Claude CLI mode
   - Investigate API-based agent invocation
   - Explore headless browser automation
4. Update MVP plan to use PRIMARY CLAUDE orchestration
5. Ship v1.1 with interactive mode (still valuable)
6. Revisit daemon in v1.3 when blocker resolved
```

## NEEDS WORK Decision: Fixable Issues

**Conditions:**
- [x] Tests pass but with workarounds needed
- [x] Performance issues but functionally works
- [x] Minor bugs that don't block core functionality

**Recommendation:**
```
⚠️ NEEDS WORK

Daemon is viable but needs improvements before shipping.

Issues Found:
1. [Issue 1: e.g., "Agent invocation slow (2-3 minutes)"]
2. [Issue 2: e.g., "Error handling logs errors but doesn't retry"]
3. [Issue 3: e.g., "Handoff latency >30 seconds"]

Severity Assessment:
- Blocker issues: [count]
- Major issues: [count]
- Minor issues: [count]

Effort to Fix:
- Estimated time: [X hours/days]
- Complexity: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]

Recommendation:
[Option A: Fix and ship - if effort <2 days]
[Option B: Ship with known limitations - if effort >2 days]
[Option C: Defer daemon - if fundamental issues]

Next Steps:
1. Prioritize issues by severity
2. Fix blocker issues first
3. Re-test after fixes
4. Document any remaining limitations
5. [Decide: Ship or defer based on re-test results]
```

## Appendix B: Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Daemon won't start
**Symptoms:** `starforge daemon start` fails
**Causes:**
- Stale PID file
- Missing dependencies (fswatch, jq)
- Lock file exists

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Clean up stale files
rm -f .claude/daemon.pid
rmdir .claude/daemon.lock 2>/dev/null

# Check dependencies
which fswatch  # Should return path
which jq       # Should return path

# Check logs
tail -20 .claude/logs/daemon.log
```

### Issue: Trigger not detected
**Symptoms:** Trigger file created but no log entry
**Causes:**
- fswatch not running
- Trigger file wrong extension (not `.trigger`)
- Permissions issue

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check fswatch running
ps aux | grep fswatch

# Restart daemon
starforge daemon restart

# Check file extension
ls .claude/triggers/*.trigger

# Check permissions
chmod 644 .claude/triggers/*.trigger
```

### Issue: Agent invocation fails
**Symptoms:** Trigger detected but agent doesn't run
**Causes:**
- Claude CLI not in PATH
- MCP server not executable
- Invalid agent name

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check Claude CLI
which claude
claude --version

# Check MCP server
ls -la .claude/bin/mcp-server.sh
# Should show -rwxr-xr-x (executable)

# Make executable if needed
chmod +x .claude/bin/mcp-server.sh

# Check agent name
cat .claude/triggers/[trigger-file] | jq '.to_agent'
# Should be one of: orchestrator, tpm, senior-engineer, junior-engineer, qa-engineer
```

### Issue: Daemon hangs
**Symptoms:** Daemon process exists but not responding
**Causes:**
- Agent process hung
- Timeout not working
- Infinite loop

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check daemon process
ps aux | grep daemon-runner

# Kill and restart
starforge daemon stop
# If that doesn't work:
kill -KILL $(cat .claude/daemon.pid)
rm .claude/daemon.pid
rmdir .claude/daemon.lock

# Start fresh
starforge daemon start
```

# Appendix E: Automated Test Suite for Real Agent Invocation

## Overview

In addition to the manual test procedures outlined above, automated test scripts have been created to validate the real agent invocation feature. These tests are located in `tests/daemon/` and can be run independently or as part of the CI pipeline.

## Test 1.4: Real Agent Invocation

**File:** `tests/daemon/test_1.4_agent_invocation.sh`

### Objective

Validate that the daemon invokes real Claude CLI agents instead of using simulation mode.

### Key Changes from Manual Test Plan

- **Removed:** Checks for "Simulating agent execution" log messages (simulation mode should not be used)
- **Added:** Checks for real Claude CLI invocation patterns:
  - MCP server process spawning
  - `claude --mcp stdio` command execution
  - Agent PID tracking
- **Validation:** Confirms that real agent invocation is used, not simulation

### Test Execution

```bash
cd /path/to/starforge-project
./tests/daemon/test_1.4_agent_invocation.sh
```

### Success Criteria

- Daemon starts successfully
- Trigger is detected and processed
- Real agent invocation patterns are found in daemon logs
- NO simulation mode detected
- Agent PID tracking is present

### Expected Output

```

## Test 1.5: End-to-End Agent Execution

**File:** `tests/daemon/test_1.5_end_to_end.sh`

### Objective

Validate that agents actually execute tasks and produce real work output (not simulated results).

### Key Changes from Manual Test Plan

- **Removed:** Simulation-specific assertions
- **Added:** Validation that agents produce actual output files:
  - File creation check
  - Content verification
  - Real execution confirmation
- **Validation:** Confirms REAL_AGENT_INVOCATION flag behavior

### Test Execution

```bash
cd /path/to/starforge-project
./tests/daemon/test_1.5_end_to_end.sh
```

### Success Criteria

- Agent creates actual output file (not simulated)
- File contains expected content
- No simulation mode detected in logs
- REAL_AGENT_INVOCATION flag set to true (or default)
- Trigger processed and archived

### Expected Output

```

  Output content correct: ✓
  Simulation mode: ✓ NOT USED
  Real work produced: ✓ CONFIRMED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Test 1.5: End-to-End Agent Execution PASSED
```

---

## Test 1.6: REAL_AGENT_INVOCATION Feature Flag

**File:** `tests/daemon/test_1.6_feature_flag.sh`

### Objective

NEW TEST: Validate that the `REAL_AGENT_INVOCATION` environment variable controls agent invocation mode.

### Test Cases

#### Case 1: Simulation Mode (`REAL_AGENT_INVOCATION=false`)

- Set flag to `false`
- Start daemon
- Verify simulation mode is used
- Verify NO real Claude CLI invocation

#### Case 2: Real Invocation Mode (`REAL_AGENT_INVOCATION=true`)

- Set flag to `true`
- Start daemon
- Verify real agent invocation is used
- Verify NO simulation mode

#### Case 3: Graceful Fallback (Claude CLI not found)

- Test behavior when Claude CLI is not available
- Verify daemon either:
  - Falls back to simulation mode, or
  - Logs error and fails gracefully

#### Case 4: Flag Toggle Between Restarts

- Start daemon with flag=false
- Restart daemon with flag=true
- Verify behavior changes based on flag

### Test Execution

```bash
cd /path/to/starforge-project
./tests/daemon/test_1.6_feature_flag.sh
```

### Success Criteria

- Case 1: Simulation mode activated when flag=false
- Case 2: Real invocation mode activated when flag=true
- Case 3: Graceful fallback when Claude CLI unavailable
- Case 4: Flag changes respected across restarts

### Expected Output

```

## Running All Daemon Tests

To run all three tests in sequence:

```bash
cd /path/to/starforge-project

# Run Test 1.4: Real Agent Invocation
./tests/daemon/test_1.4_agent_invocation.sh

# Run Test 1.5: End-to-End Agent Execution
./tests/daemon/test_1.5_end_to_end.sh

# Run Test 1.6: Feature Flag
./tests/daemon/test_1.6_feature_flag.sh
```

Or run all tests with a single command (if test runner exists):

```bash
cd /path/to/starforge-project
for test in tests/daemon/test_*.sh; do
  echo "Running $test..."
  bash "$test" || echo "FAILED: $test"
done
```

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests can be integrated into the CI pipeline to automatically validate real agent invocation behavior on every commit:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/daemon-tests.yml
name: Daemon Agent Invocation Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  daemon-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          # Install fswatch, jq, etc.
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y fswatch jq
      
      - name: Setup Claude CLI (if available)
        run: |
          # Setup Claude CLI for testing
          # This step may be conditional
      
      - name: Run daemon invocation tests
        run: |
          ./tests/daemon/test_1.4_agent_invocation.sh
          ./tests/daemon/test_1.5_end_to_end.sh
          ./tests/daemon/test_1.6_feature_flag.sh
```

## Test Coverage Summary

| Test | Coverage | Real Invocation | Simulation | Feature Flag |
|------|----------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| 1.4  | Agent invocation patterns | ✓ | ✗ | - |
| 1.5  | End-to-end execution | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| 1.6  | Feature flag behavior | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Notes

- **Test 1.4** focuses on verifying invocation patterns (logs, processes)
- **Test 1.5** focuses on actual work output (files created, content verified)
- **Test 1.6** focuses on feature flag control (switching between modes)

- All tests are designed to work with the current simulation code (baseline)
- Tests will **PASS** when simulation is used (current state)
- Tests will **DETECT** when real invocation is implemented (future state)
- Once Task 4 (implement real invocation) is complete, tests should still PASS but with different indicators
