# StarForge User Experience Vision

**The North Star**: StarForge should feel like Slack + GitHub for an AI team.

---

## Executive Summary

StarForge is not just a technical framework‚Äîit's a **user experience transformation**. We're building a system where interacting with AI agents feels identical to working with a human engineering team.

**Core Principle**: Every feature decision must answer: *"Does this make StarForge feel more like a human team?"*

---

## The Benchmark: Human Team Interaction

When you work with human engineers, the interaction is:

### 1. Communicate Intent
- **How**: Slack message, email, verbal conversation, ticket description
- **Where**: Wherever it's natural for you
- **Format**: Natural language, imprecise is fine, context is shared

### 2. Trust Autonomy
- **What**: They work independently without constant supervision
- **When**: Asynchronous‚Äîyou don't watch them code
- **How**: They coordinate amongst themselves, make technical decisions

### 3. Receive Updates
- **Where**: Slack notifications, standup updates, PR notifications
- **Frequency**: Progress updates, blockers, completion alerts
- **Format**: Digestible summaries, not verbose logs

### 4. Review Output
- **What**: Pull requests, demos, documentation
- **Where**: GitHub, staging environment, design mockups
- **How**: Code review, functional testing, acceptance criteria

### 5. Provide Feedback
- **When**: After reviewing their work
- **How**: PR comments, approval/rejection, new requirements
- **Result**: They iterate or move to next task

## The Anti-Pattern: Current AI UX

What we DON'T want:

‚ùå **Permission Hell**: Approving every file read, bash command, tool invocation
‚ùå **Micromanagement**: Watching agents work step-by-step in real-time
‚ùå **Manual Coordination**: Creating JSON trigger files by hand
‚ùå **Synchronous Babysitting**: Sitting in terminal session pressing Enter repeatedly
‚ùå **Context Loss**: Agent forgets everything between sessions
‚ùå **Role Confusion**: One agent trying to do everything poorly

**The Problem**: Current AI tools make you the bottleneck, not the driver.

## The Target Experience

### User Persona: Tech Lead (Primary)

**Name**: Sarah
**Role**: Engineering Lead at 20-person startup
**Goal**: Ship 5 features this sprint without hiring more devs
**Pain**: Context switching, code reviews, architecture decisions

#### Sarah's Ideal Day with StarForge

**9:00 AM - Describe What to Build**
```
Sarah: (In Slack-like interface)
"Build user authentication with magic links.
Support email verification, session management,
and remember-me functionality."
```

**9:01 AM - Walk Away**
- No permission prompts
- No JSON files to create
- No terminal commands to run
- StarForge daemon handles everything

**11:30 AM - Check Notification**
```
Discord: üü¢ senior-engineer completed breakdown
‚Üí View breakdown: 5 subtasks, 8-12h estimate
‚Üí TPM created GitHub issues #42-#46
```

**11:35 AM - Approve Plan** (Optional - can auto-proceed)
```
Sarah: "Looks good, proceed"
```

**2:00 PM - Progress Update**
```
Discord: ‚è≥ junior-dev-a working on ticket #42 (2h elapsed)
Discord: ‚è≥ junior-dev-b working on ticket #43 (1.5h elapsed)
```

**4:30 PM - Review PR**
```
GitHub: üîî junior-dev-a opened PR #167
Sarah reviews code, requests changes
```

**5:00 PM - End of Day**
- 3 PRs ready for review
- 2 agents still working (will notify when done)
- Sarah goes home, agents work autonomously

**Next Morning - Merge Results**
```
Discord: ‚úÖ junior-dev-b completed ticket #43 (PR #168 ready)
Sarah: Approves, merges
Feature ships
```

**Key UX Wins**:
- Fire and forget
- Asynchronous updates
- Review, not micromanage
- Feels like delegating to humans

---

## User Persona: Solo Developer (Secondary)

**Name**: Alex
**Role**: Indie hacker building SaaS
**Goal**: Build MVP in evenings/weekends
**Pain**: Limited time, wants help but can't afford team

#### Alex's Ideal Week with StarForge

**Monday Evening**:
```
Alex: "Add Stripe subscription billing"
‚Üí Walks away, watches Netflix
‚Üí Check phone: "senior-engineer finished breakdown"
‚Üí Approve: "Do it"
```

**Tuesday-Thursday**:
- Agents work during the day while Alex is at day job
- Gets Discord notifications: "PR ready for review"
- Reviews PRs during lunch break or evening

**Friday Evening**:
- Merges completed work
- Feature shipped without writing code
- Spends time on product strategy instead

**Key UX Wins**:
- Maximizes limited time
- Works during day job
- No context switching overhead

## Decision Framework for Product Features

When evaluating any feature, ask:

### Primary Filter: "Does this feel like a human team?"

**Example Applications**:

‚ùå **Bad**: "User must create JSON trigger file to assign work"
- **Why Bad**: You don't send JSON to human engineers
- **Human Equivalent**: "Can you work on ticket #42?"

‚úÖ **Good**: "User says 'work on ticket #42' in natural language"
- **Why Good**: Exactly how you'd delegate to human
- **Implementation**: Parse intent, create trigger internally

‚ùå **Bad**: "User approves every file read"
- **Why Bad**: You don't approve when human engineer reads code
- **Human Equivalent**: They have access, they work autonomously

‚úÖ **Good**: "One-time trust grant for project scope"
- **Why Good**: Like giving engineer repo access on day 1
- **Implementation**: Permission bundling, daemon mode

‚ùå **Bad**: "User watches agent work in terminal"
- **Why Bad**: You don't sit behind engineer watching them code
- **Human Equivalent**: They work, you get notified when done

‚úÖ **Good**: "User gets Discord notification when PR ready"
- **Why Good**: Like human posting "PR up for review"
- **Implementation**: Daemon + webhooks + Discord integration

### Secondary Filters

**Reduces Friction**
- Does it eliminate manual steps?
- Does it reduce permission prompts?
- Does it work asynchronously?

**Increases Trust**
- Does output quality improve?
- Are agents smarter/more reliable?
- Is work auditable/reviewable?

**Feels Natural**
- Would non-technical PM understand it?
- Is it how teams actually work?
- Does it match existing tools (Slack, GitHub)?

## Implementation Implications

### Current Architecture Issues

**Problem 1: Primary Claude as Interactive Orchestrator**
```
User ‚Üí Primary Claude ‚Üí Permission prompt ‚Üí Task tool ‚Üí Permission prompt
```

**Why This Breaks UX**:
- User is bottleneck
- Synchronous interaction required
- Permission hell
- Doesn't scale to "walk away" model

**Solution**:
```
User ‚Üí Natural interface ‚Üí Daemon ‚Üí Agents (autonomous) ‚Üí Notifications
```

### Current Architecture Strengths

**Problem 2: Daemon Exists But Wrong Entry Point**
- ‚úÖ Daemon can run agents autonomously
- ‚úÖ Trigger system enables async coordination
- ‚ùå User must manually create trigger files (bad UX)
- ‚ùå No natural language input layer

**Solution**:
- Keep daemon + triggers (good architecture)
- Add natural language input translator
- Remove manual trigger file creation

---

## Roadmap Alignment

### Phase 1: Fix Permission Hell (0-3 months)

**Goal**: Eliminate constant approval prompts

**Approaches**:
1. **Permission Bundling**: Pre-approve common operations
2. **Daemon Mode**: One approval ‚Üí Full autonomy
3. **Wrapper Scripts**: Approved scripts that call Task tool internally

**Success Metric**: User presses Enter <5 times per feature (from ~50+ today)

### Phase 2: Async Notification Layer (3-6 months)

**Goal**: User doesn't need to watch agents work

**Features**:
- Discord integration (already built, needs to work)
- GitHub PR notifications
- Email digests (daily summary)
- Mobile app notifications (future)

**Success Metric**: User can walk away for 4+ hours, come back to completed work

### Phase 3: Natural Language Input (6-12 months)

**Goal**: Remove technical barriers to input

**Features**:
- Slack bot integration
- Email-to-ticket system
- Voice input (future)
- Conversational breakdown refinement

**Success Metric**: Non-technical PM can use StarForge

### Phase 4: Intelligent Autonomy (12-24 months)

**Goal**: Agents make better decisions than humans

**Features**:
- Engineering intelligence (just built!)
- Auto-approve simple PRs (if tests pass + high confidence)
- Proactive suggestions ("I noticed X, should I fix it?")
- Learn from past decisions

**Success Metric**: User reviews PRs less than 10% of the time

---

## Anti-Goals (What We're NOT Building)

**NOT a Chat Interface**
- Slack/chat is just ONE input method
- Some users prefer CLI, some prefer GitHub issues
- Interface-agnostic architecture

**NOT Fully Autonomous (Yet)**
- Human approval for merges (safety)
- Human defines requirements
- Agents propose, human decides
- Gradually increase autonomy as trust grows

**NOT a Platform Lock-In**
- Work with existing tools (GitHub, Slack, Discord)
- Don't force new tools on users
- Integrate with their workflow

**NOT CLI-Only**
- CLI is current implementation detail
- Target: Work however user prefers
- Future: Web UI, mobile, integrations

---

## Success Metrics

### UX Quality Metrics

**Time to First Value**
- Current: ~30 mins (install, setup, first feature)
- Target: <5 mins (one command, walk away)

**Approval Prompts per Feature**
- Current: 50+ (permission hell)
- Phase 1 Target: <5
- Phase 2 Target: 1 (just approve the plan)

**Active Supervision Time**
- Current: Continuous (watch agents work)
- Target: <5 mins (describe task, review PR)

**Async Capability**
- Current: 0% (must babysit)
- Target: 100% (fire and forget)

### User Sentiment

**"Feels Like a Team" Score**
- Survey question: "Does StarForge feel like working with human engineers?"
- Target: 8+/10

**Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
- "How likely to recommend to colleague?"
- Target: 50+ (excellent for dev tools)

**Frustration Points**
- Track: What causes users to give up?
- Target: <10% abandonment rate

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Async by Default
Every interaction should support "describe task, walk away, come back later."

### 2. Notifications Over Logs
Users want summaries, not verbose output. "PR ready" not "ran 47 commands."

### 3. Progressive Trust
Start conservative (human approves everything), earn autonomy (auto-approve simple tasks).

### 4. Human Fallback
When uncertain, ask human. Don't guess. Don't block. Ask clearly and wait.

### 5. Familiar Interfaces
Use tools users already know (GitHub, Slack, Discord). Don't invent new paradigms.

### 6. Invisible Coordination
Agents coordinate amongst themselves. User sees results, not process.

## Open Questions

**Question 1: How much autonomy is too much?**
- Should agents auto-merge PRs that pass all tests?
- Should agents create tickets without human approval?
- How do we build trust gradually?

**Question 2: What's the right input interface?**
- CLI for developers?
- Slack for teams?
- GitHub issues for product mode?
- All of the above?

**Question 3: How do we handle errors gracefully?**
- Agent gets stuck ‚Üí Notify user or retry?
- Tests fail ‚Üí Block merge or create ticket?
- Conflicting requirements ‚Üí Ask for clarification immediately?

**Question 4: What's the unit of work?**
- Feature (too big, takes days)?
- Ticket (right size, hours)?
- Subtask (too small, minutes)?

## Competitive Comparison

| Experience Dimension | Cursor | Devin | Copilot | **StarForge (Target)** |
|---------------------|--------|-------|---------|------------------------|
| **Autonomy** | Low (assistive) | High (fully autonomous) | Low (autocomplete) | **Medium (delegative)** |
| **Async Capable** | No (in IDE) | Yes | No | **Yes** |
| **Feels Like Team** | No (tool) | No (black box) | No (tool) | **Yes (delegation)** |
| **Human Control** | Full | Minimal | Full | **Balanced** |
| **Multi-Agent** | No | No | No | **Yes** |

**StarForge's Differentiation**: The sweet spot between "assistive tool" and "autonomous black box."

## Implementation Checklist

When building any feature, verify:

- [ ] Can user describe it in natural language?
- [ ] Can user walk away after initiating?
- [ ] Does user get notified at key milestones?
- [ ] Is human approval required only at decision points?
- [ ] Would this interaction work with human engineers?
- [ ] Does it reduce permission prompts?
- [ ] Is coordination between agents invisible?
- [ ] Can non-technical user understand what happened?

If any answer is "No," reconsider the design.

---

## Vision Statement

**StarForge transforms AI coding from babysitting automation to delegating to a trusted team.**

You should interact with StarForge the same way you'd work with senior engineers:
- Describe what you want
- Trust them to execute
- Get notified of progress
- Review their work
- Provide feedback

When using StarForge feels indistinguishable from Slack messages to your team + GitHub PR reviews, we've succeeded.
