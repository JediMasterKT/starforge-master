## Validation Methodology

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (COMPLETED)
✅ Create test files (TDD red phase)
✅ Create learning module
✅ Create assessment tools
✅ Create documentation

### Phase 2: Live Teaching Session (PENDING)
⏳ Recruit learner (new to StarForge triggers)
⏳ Conduct onboarding using Directness mode
⏳ Record session (timestamps, dialogue, observations)
⏳ Document struggles and breakthroughs
⏳ Measure: total time, time to first success

### Phase 3: Assessment (PENDING)
⏳ Wait 24 hours
⏳ Administer retention test
⏳ Administer mastery challenge
⏳ Collect satisfaction survey
⏳ Calculate all metrics

### Phase 4: Analysis (PENDING)
⏳ Run integration test suite
⏳ Compare metrics against targets
⏳ Document learnings in teacher-agent/learnings.md
⏳ Update teacher-agent.md if needed
⏳ Create final report

---

## Expected Outcomes (Targets)

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Onboarding Time | <60 min | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending |
| Time to First Success | <15 min | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending |
| Knowledge Retention | >80% | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending |
| Skill Mastery | >70% | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending |
| Developer Satisfaction | >4.0/5.0 | [TBD] | ⏳ Pending |

---

## Testing Approach: Directness Mode

**Why Directness?**
Per teacher-agent definition, Directness is the preferred default teaching mode.

**Characteristics:**
- Challenge-based learning (minimal scaffolding)
- Fast feedback loops
- Learning through doing, not passive reading
- Encourages problem-solving and discovery

**Hypothesis:**
Directness mode will achieve target metrics faster than traditional instruction-based approaches.

## Running the Validation

### Step 1: Conduct Teaching Session
```bash
# Teacher uses this template:
open templates/teaching-sessions/session-228-trigger-onboarding.md

# Fill in:
# - Start/end timestamps
# - Learner responses
# - Observations
# - Metrics
```

### Step 2: Wait 24 Hours

### Step 3: Run Assessments
```bash
# Knowledge retention
bash tests/integration/assessments/trigger-knowledge-retention.sh

# Skill mastery
bash tests/integration/assessments/trigger-mastery-challenge.sh

# Satisfaction survey (manual)
open tests/integration/assessments/satisfaction-survey.md
```

### Step 4: Run Integration Tests
```bash
# Full validation suite
bash tests/integration/test_teacher_agent_effectiveness.sh
```

### Step 5: Analyze Results
- Review metrics against targets
- Document learnings
- Update agent definition if needed
- Close issue #228 if all targets met

---

## Success Criteria

**Validation PASSES if ALL criteria met:**

✅ Onboarding time <60 minutes
✅ Time to first success <15 minutes
✅ Knowledge retention >80%
✅ Skill mastery >70%
✅ Developer satisfaction >4.0/5.0

**Validation FAILS if ANY criteria not met:**

❌ Onboarding takes >60 minutes
❌ First success takes >15 minutes
❌ Retention <80%
❌ Mastery <70%
❌ Satisfaction <4.0/5.0

## Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Learner Selection Bias
**Risk:** Choosing learner with prior trigger knowledge skews results

**Mitigation:** Verify learner is genuinely new to StarForge triggers, document prior knowledge in session template

### Risk 2: Teaching Mode Mismatch
**Risk:** Directness mode may not work for all learning styles

**Mitigation:** Document struggles, be prepared to adapt mid-session, note when mode switch might be better

### Risk 3: 24-Hour Retention Window
**Risk:** Learner may review materials before retention test

**Mitigation:** Explicitly request no review between session and assessment, trust-based system

### Risk 4: Assessment Subjectivity
**Risk:** Scoring may be inconsistent or biased

**Mitigation:** Use automated scripts with objective criteria, keyword-based scoring

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Recruit learner for teaching session
2. **Conduct Session:** Follow session template, record everything
3. **Wait 24 Hours:** No contact with learner during this period
4. **Administer Assessments:** Run all 3 assessment tools
5. **Run Integration Tests:** Execute test suite, capture results
6. **Document Findings:** Update teacher-agent learnings
7. **Report Results:** Complete this validation report
8. **Close Issue #228:** If all criteria met

---

## Validation Timeline

**Infrastructure Setup:** 2025-10-28 (COMPLETE)
**Teaching Session:** [TBD - schedule with learner]
**24-Hour Wait:** [TBD + 1 day]
**Assessments:** [TBD + 1 day]
**Final Report:** [TBD + 1 day]
